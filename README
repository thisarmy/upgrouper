UPGROUPER
=========

A widget for uploading files via drag and drop straight into different
groupings and then sorting them.

It was made for use with product, page and range images on someammo. See it in
action on http://someammo.com/.


Example
-------

There's a node and express based test server included. Run it with:

    node server.js

and then visit http://localhost:8080/test.html in your browser.

It deliberately pauses uploads between chunks so that you can test upload
progress locally and then it creates previews in the media/ subdirectory using
imagemagick. It then returns some metadata as json so that the frontend can
represent the thumbnails.
